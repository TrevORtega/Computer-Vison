# Computer Vision

Working under the research provision of Dr. Wehrwein at WWU, using Deep Learning to count populations of different types of birds in the Blaine Harbor from overhead drone images!

This is a secondary repo, made to track and preserve significant progress in the project (i.e switching architectures). The nitty gritty is held to a private repo for the Wehrwein research group.

Approaches have included object detection, implementation of Global Sum Pooling (GSP paper), and "Blob" semantic segmentation (LCFCN paper)
