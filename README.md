Working under the research provision of Dr. Wehrwein at WWU, using Deep Learning to count populations of different types of birds in the Blaine Harbor from overhead drone images!

Approaches have included object detection, implementation of Global Sum Pooling (GSP paper), and "Blob" semantic segmentation (LCFCN paper)
